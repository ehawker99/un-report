This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, life expectancy, and CO2 emissions. Out goal is to determine to what degree a country's economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP. 

```{r data set, include=FALSE}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```

```{r gdp life exp 1997, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) + 
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop/1000000) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy", 
       title = "Do people in wealthy countries live longer?", 
       size = "Population in millions")

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
nCountries <- gapminder_1997 %>%  select(country) %>% n_distinct()
#minGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>% summarize(min(gdpPercap)) %>% 
#  pull()
#maxGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>% summarize(max(gdpPercap)) %>% 
#  pull()

minGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>% summarize(round(min(gdpPercap))) %>% 
  pull()
maxGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>% summarize(round(max(gdpPercap))) %>% 
  pull()
```

The above plot shows the relationship between GPD per capita and life expectency for a total of `r nCountries` countries. For this set of countries, economic wealth ranged from a minimum of USD `r minGDP`` to a maximum of USD `r maxGDP` per capita.
